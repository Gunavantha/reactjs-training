# Day-2  

### Info  
 Fisrt day we just created React App in our local sytem. In Day 2 we discussed what is components in React. React contains two kinds of components, one is Class Component and other is Function Component. You will get more details [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).   
 
 From the project, the file [Button.js](https://github.com/arung86/reactjs-training/blob/day2/src/Button.js) is rendering two components to [App.js](https://github.com/arung86/reactjs-training/blob/day2/src/App.js) file in that FButton is a Function Component and CButton is a Class Component.
